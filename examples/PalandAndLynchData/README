In this directory are files that can be used to repeat the analyses by Paland and Lynch (2006).
PalandAndLynch28Concatenate.fasta and PalandAndLynch28Tree.dnd are an alignment and a tree (respectively) similar to those used in Paland and Lynch (2006) to test for differences in Dn/Ds among branches. Sequences are named as in the paper: S* sequences are from sexual strains, and A* are from asexual strains.

PalandAndLynch30Concatenate.fasta and PalandAndLynch30Tree.dnd are the same data as above, plus sequences 2 and 3, from Daphnia melanica, which Paland and Lynch used as outgroups.
